![Banner](public/liam-banner.jpg)

## What is it?

LiamAI is an AI with the ability to talk over the phone and one small twist, it has the ability to search public records on the fly for information related to the caller.

This information is then used in a prompt sent to GPT-4 and can be presented in anyway you like. By default, the ai is instructed to perform a threatening Liam Neeson impression from Taken.

The AI relies on 4 services,

1. Endato - https://endato.com/ Public information database, used to find details on the caller
2. OpenAI - https://openai.com/ GPT-4 generates a threat based upon user information
3. Eleven Labs (Optional) - https://elevenlabs.io/ - Provides realistic text to speech services
4. Twilio - https://www.twilio.com/en-us Makes it easy to make and recieve phone calls using their API.
